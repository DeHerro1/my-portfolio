          <h3>Web Developer.</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a Frontend Developer. Actually, IT is not only my professional
            background. It is also and above all a passion that has grown since
            I was 16 years old. I always liked to get into projects using the
            skills that I did not have or were even spare pure programming like
            web development, mobile development etc... This allowed me to learn
            to be autonomous and to learn on my own, certainly not without
            difficulties far from it, but I always managed to overcome the
            obstacles and solve the problems I encountered !
