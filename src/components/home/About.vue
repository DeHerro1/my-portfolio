          <h3>Web Developer.</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a self-taught web developer with experience in designing new
            features from ideation to production, taking into consideration the
            user experience while writing reusable and efficient code. I have
            found myself regularly called upon to tackle technical challenges,
            resolve coding issues and engage with different teams working on
            different projects. My love of coding drives me internally and I
            relish every opportunity to tackle the deepest technical challenges.
            From developing a user-friendly frontend to building reliable web
            servers, I've worked on many projects. Also, have experience with
            cross-platform mobile application development. This allowed me to
            learn to be autonomous and to learn on my own, certainly not without
            difficulties far from it, but I always managed to overcome the
            obstacles and solve the problems I encountered.
